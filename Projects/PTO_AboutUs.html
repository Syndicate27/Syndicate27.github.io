		<h1>What We Believe In</h1>
		<p id="intro_text">We believe that schools achieve a great deal in teaching our students but that they could achieve even more with Parent involvement. Our PTO Organization at Harmony School of Innovation consists of an active body of parents whose children attend the school. We do anything and everything to ensure that the kids attending Innovation get to participate in fun, rearding activities and fundraisers for trips! There are a ton of other things we help out with at the school such as volunteering for events and working together with the teachers on the campus. If you want to make a huge difference in the student environment at Innovation then join our Parent Teacher Organization!</p>
